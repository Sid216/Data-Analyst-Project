# Data Analysis Projects 
* Analyzed COVID-19 data to evaluate infection and death rates, compared cases to population across countries, tracked vaccination progress, and created a view to calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated using complex SQL queries and temporary tables.
* Created a comprehensive Tableau dashboard, featuring multi-faceted visualizations to analyze global death counts by continent; integrated a predictive line graph to model potential trends and a detailed world map to depict the percentage of the population infected per country, significantly enhancing data-driven insights and strategic decision-making capabilities.
